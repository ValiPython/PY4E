# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:

# width = 17
# height = 12.0

# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type
# (of the value of the expression).
#
#     width//2
#
#     width/2.0
#
#     height/3
#
#     1 + 2 * 5
#
# Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

width = 17
height = 12.0

a = width // 2
b = width / 2.0
c = height / 3
d = 1 + 2 * 5

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
